# Data Analysis with R
This repository stores copies of Jupyter notebooks and data that are used for a half-semester course on data anaylsis with R. These materials are based on the textbook 

* Cotton, R. Learning R: A Step-By-Step Guide to Data Analysis. Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., ISBN 9781449357108, 2013.

**For Fall 2024**

The following schedule should be used as a guide for keeping in time for turning work in. This is a self-paced class for the most part, however, and the notebooks are meant to be interactive --- you should be filling in blanks in the text and in the code, and answering questions throughout each notebook. There is an associated Google Classroom on which I will provide feedback and grades for the completed notebooks.
